# PlutoSDR_BLE_Stream_Capturing

Here is showing the method to capture the BLE data stream with the ADALAM-PLUTO.

Where the RF coverage of PlutoSDR is from 325 MHz to 3.8 GHz, apperantly it's sufficient for 2.4GHz bandwidth.

With the ADALAM-PLUTO, we can realize the data capturing through Matlab, Simulink, Gnu Radio and so forth.

    1. For the Matlab, the first is the Pluto environment setting, we can follow the instruction (Capturing_Matlab.pdf).
